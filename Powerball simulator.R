#This is a simulation of how likely it is to win the lottery as well as the powerball. On average, there is a 1 in 292 million chance
#of winning the powerball. Therefore, it's unlikely the simulation will return a powerball winner unless you run this about 300,000,000 
# times. Which, I don't recommend as it would take hours or possibly days for your computer to run. Instead, you can un-commment-out and
#run the lines in the 'for-loop' to rig the system and pick a winning ticket, forcing a match. This is done just to confirm the 
# simulator works.
